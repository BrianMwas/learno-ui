# Learno Frontend

This is the frontend for **Learno**, an AI-based teaching service that allows for **visual interactions** and **progressive learning**.  
It has been built with **ShadCN** and **React (TypeScript)**.

---

## 🧩 Running the App

To start the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will initialize and launch the frontend.  
⚠️ **Note:** The backend must be running for the app to work correctly.

## 💡 App Overview

The interface is structured into two main sections:
- **Right Panel:** A chat interface for user-bot interactions.  
- **Left Panel:** A visual display area that updates dynamically with each bot response.

The visuals are designed to reflect data sent by the AI, creating an engaging learning experience.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

Due to limited credits for image generation and time spent fixing bugs and refining the flow:
- Some visual elements may not render as expected.  
- Certain interactions might be incomplete.

Despite these challenges, the goal was to deliver a coherent and well-structured learning experience.

## 🙏 Closing Note

Thank you for the opportunity to present this project.  
If given more time and resources—especially to refine the backend integration—the platform could be fully realized as intended.
